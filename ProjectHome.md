anjaro stands for Android Java Robot

This java framework provides a Java Api for building robots. It runs on Android as well as on Raspberry Pi (and probably on other Java providing platforms) and its target is to be flexible and extendable.

You can do a lot of things starting from remote controlling your raspberry pi robot from your Android smartphone over Bluetooth, or having the Android phone itself on the robot and using its sensor features like gyroscope, camera etc.

You can extend the framework writing your own sensors like sonar sensors as well as your own actors like motors, etc.

Future releases will also provide connections to Arduino boards using Android Open Accessory Development Kit or even simpler data transfer using the audio jack.

Please take a look also to the official home page http://www.anjaro.org

There you will also find the download versions (for now).
